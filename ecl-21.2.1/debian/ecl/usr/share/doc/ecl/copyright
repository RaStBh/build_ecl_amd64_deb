 This file adds definitions appropriate for environments in which
 volatile load of a given type has acquire semantics, and volatile
 store of a given type has release semantics.  This is arguably
 supposed to be true with the standard Itanium software conventions.
 Empirically gcc/ia64 does some reordering of ordinary operations
 around volatiles even when we think it should not.  GCC v3.3 and
 earlier could reorder a volatile store with another store.  As of
 March 2005, gcc pre-4 reuses some previously computed common
 subexpressions across a volatile load; hence, we now add compiler
 barriers for gcc.

 earlier write.  Real x86 implementations seem to be in this category,
 except apparently for some IDT WinChips, which we ignore.

 m88k Foreign Function Interface
 .
 This file attempts to provide all the FFI entry points which can reliably
 be implemented in C.
 .
 Only OpenBSD/m88k is currently supported; other platforms (such as
 Motorola's SysV/m88k) could be supported with the following tweaks:
 .
 - non-OpenBSD systems use an `outgoing parameter area' as part of the
 88BCS calling convention, which is not supported under OpenBSD from
 release 3.6 onwards.  Supporting it should be as easy as taking it
 into account when adjusting the stack, in the assembly code.
 .
 - the logic deciding whether a function argument gets passed through
 registers, or on the stack, has changed several times in OpenBSD in
 edge cases (especially for structs larger than 32 bytes being passed
 by value). The code below attemps to match the logic used by the
 system compiler of OpenBSD 5.3, i.e. gcc 3.3.6 with many m88k backend
 fixes.

 A structure for constant databases
 19960914
 Copyright 1996
 D. J. Bernstein, djb@pobox.com
 .
 A cdb is an associative array: it maps strings (``keys'') to strings
 (``data'').
 .
 A cdb contains 256 pointers to linearly probed open hash tables. The
 hash tables contain pointers to (key,data) pairs. A cdb is stored in
 a single file on disk:
 .
 +----------------+---------+-------+-------+-----+---------+
 | p0 p1 ... p255 | records | hash0 | hash1 | ... | hash255 |
 +----------------+---------+-------+-------+-----+---------+
 .
 Each of the 256 initial pointers states a position and a length. The
 position is the starting byte position of the hash table. The length
 is the number of slots in the hash table.
 .
 Records are stored sequentially, without special alignment. A record
 states a key length, a data length, the key, and the data.
 .
 Each hash table slot states a hash value and a byte position. If the
 byte position is 0, the slot is empty. Otherwise, the slot points to
 a record whose key has that hash value.
 .
 Positions, lengths, and hash values are 32-bit quantities, stored in
 little-endian form in 4 bytes. Thus a cdb must fit into 4 gigabytes.
 .
 A record is located as follows. Compute the hash value of the key in
 the record. The hash value modulo 256 is the number of a hash table.
 The hash value divided by 256, modulo the length of that table, is a
 slot number. Probe that slot, the next higher slot, and so on, until
 you find the record or run into an empty slot.

 The rep/movsl is very slow for small blocks on pentium4.  Its startup
 time seems to be about 110 cycles.  It then copies at a rate of one
 limb per cycle.  We therefore fall back to an open-coded 2 c/l copying
 loop for smaller sizes.
 .
 Ultimately, we may want to use 64-bit movd or 128-bit movdqu in some
 nifty unrolled arrangement.  Clearly, that could reach much higher
 speeds, at least for large blocks.

 ALPHA ASSEMBLY RULES AND REGULATIONS
 .
 The `.prologue N' pseudo op marks the end of instruction that needs special
 handling by unwinding.  It also says whether $27 is really needed for computing
 the gp.  The `.mask M' pseudo op says which registers are saved on the stack,
 and at what offset in the frame.
 .
 Cray T3 code is very very different...
 .
 "$6" / "$f6" etc is the usual syntax for registers, but on Unicos instead "r6"
 / "f6" is required.  We use the "r6" / "f6" forms, and have m4 defines expand
 them to "$6" or "$f6" where necessary.
 .
 "0x" introduces a hex constant in gas and DEC as, but on Unicos "^X" is
 required.  The X() macro accomodates this difference.
 .
 "cvttqc" is required by DEC as, "cvttq/c" is required by Unicos, and gas will
 accept either.  We use cvttqc and have an m4 define expand to cvttq/c where
 necessary.
 .
 "not" as an alias for "ornot r31, ..." is available in gas and DEC as, but not
 the Unicos assembler.  The full "ornot" must be used.

 THE GNU MP LIBRARY
 .
 GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
 integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  It has a rich set of
 functions, and the functions have a regular interface.
 .
 GNU MP is designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands and huge
 operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic
 type, by using fast algorithms, with carefully optimized assembly code for the
 most common inner loops for lots of CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed
 (instead of simplicity or elegance).
 .
 GNU MP is believed to be faster than any other similar library.  Its advantage
 increases with operand sizes for certain operations, since GNU MP in many
 cases has asymptotically faster algorithms.
 .
 GNU MP is free software and may be freely copied on the terms contained in the
 files COPYING.LIB and COPYING (most of GNU MP is under the former, some under
 the latter).
 .
 OVERVIEW OF GNU MP
 .
 There are five classes of functions in GNU MP.
 .
 1. Signed integer arithmetic functions (mpz).  These functions are intended
 to be easy to use, with their regular interface.  The associated type is

 The top-level x86 directory contains blended style code, meant to be
 reasonable on all x86s.

 STATUS
 .
 The code is well-optimized for AMD and Intel chips, but there's nothing
 specific for Cyrix chips, nor for actual 80386 and 80486 chips.
 .
 ASM FILES
 .
 The x86 .asm files are BSD style assembler code, first put through m4 for
 macro processing.  The generic mpn/asm-defs.m4 is used, together with
 mpn/x86/x86-defs.m4.  See comments in those files.
 .
 The code is meant for use with GNU "gas" or a system "as".  There's no
 support for assemblers that demand Intel style code.
 .
 STACK FRAME
 .
 m4 macros are used to define the parameters passed on the stack, and these
 act like comments on what the stack frame looks like too.  For example,

 The code in this directory works for Cray vector systems such as C90,
 J90, T90 (both the CFP variant and the IEEE variant) and SV1.  (For
 the T3E and T3D systems, see the `alpha' subdirectory at the same
 level as the directory containing this file.)
 .
 The cfp subdirectory is for systems utilizing the traditional Cray
 floating-point format, and the ieee subdirectory is for the newer
 systems that use the IEEE floating-point format.
 .
 There are several issues that reduces speed on Cray systems.  For
 systems with cfp floating point, the main obstacle is the forming of
 128-bit products.  For IEEE systems, adding, and in particular
 computing carry is the main issue.  There are no vectorizing
 unsigned-less-than instructions, and the sequence that implement that
 opetration is very long.
 .
 Shifting is the only operation that is simple to make fast.  All Cray
 systems have a bitblt instructions (Vi Vj,Vj<Ak and Vi Vj,Vj>Ak) that
 should be really useful.

 The default m4 `#' commenting interferes with the assembler syntax for
 immediates.  `|' would be correct, but it interferes with "||" in
 eval().  Would like to disable commenting, but that's not possible (see
 mpn/asm-defs.m4), so use `;' which should be harmless.

 The std/rep/movsl/cld is very slow for small blocks on pentium4.  Its
 startup time seems to be about 165 cycles.  It then needs 2.6 c/l.
 We therefore use an open-coded 2 c/l copying loop.
 .
 Ultimately, we may want to use 64-bit movq or 128-bit movdqu in some
 nifty unrolled arrangement.  Clearly, that could reach much higher
 speeds, at least for large blocks.

 This directory contains mpn functions optimized for MIPS3.  Example of
 processors that implement MIPS3 are R4000, R4400, R4600, R4700, and R8000.
 .
 RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES
 .
 1. On the R4000 and R4400, branches, both the plain and the "likely" ones,
 take 3 cycles to execute.  (The fastest possible loop will take 4 cycles,
 because of the delay insn.)
 .
 On the R4600, branches takes a single cycle
 .
 On the R8000, branches often take no noticable cycles, as they are
 executed in a separate function unit..
 .
 2. The R4000 and R4400 have a load latency of 4 cycles.
 .
 3. On the R4000 and R4400, multiplies take a data-dependent number of
 cycles, contrary to the SGI documentation.  There seem to be 3 or 4
 possible latencies.
 .
 4. The R1x000 processors can issue one floating-point operation, two integer
 operations, and one memory operation per cycle.  The FPU has very short
 latencies, while the integer multiply unit is non-pipelined.  We should

 execution speed of the Itanium pipeline.  With well-tuned assembly code we
 should be able to get to around 3 cycles/limb.  See README.

 gmpasm-mode is a major mode for editing m4 processed assembler code and
 m4 macro files in GMP.  It's similar to m4-mode, but has a number of
 settings better suited to GMP.

 AMD64 MPN SUBROUTINES
 .
 This directory contains mpn functions for AMD64 chips.  It might also be
 useful for 64-bit Pentiums, but that chip's poor carry handling makes it
 unlikely.  We'll need completely separate code (in a subdirectory).
 .
 RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES
 .
 The only AMD64 core as of this writing is the AMD Hammer, sold under the
 names Opteron and Athlon64.  The Hammer can sustain up to 3 instructions per
 cycle, but in practice that is only possible for integer instructions.  But
 almost any three integer instructions can issue simultaneously, including
 any 3 ALU operations, including shifts.  Up to two memory operations can
 issue each cycle.
 .
 Scheduling typically requires that load-use instructions are split into
 separate load and use instructions.  That requires more decode resources,
 and it is rarely a win.  Hammer is a deep out-of-order core.

 Runs at 2.5 cycles/limb.  With unrolling, the ulimb load and the 3
 bookkeeping increments and the `bis' that copies from r23 to r7 could be
 removed and the instruction count reduced from 31 to to 26.  We could
 thereby surely reach 2 cycles/limb, the IMUL bandwidth.

 The mmx subdirectory has MMX code suiting plain K6, the k62mmx subdirectory
 has MMX code suiting K6-2 and K6-3.  All chips in the K6 family have MMX,
 the separate directories are just so that ./configure can omit them if the
 assembler doesn't support MMX.

 POWERPC-64 MPN SUBROUTINES
 .
 This directory contains mpn functions for 64-bit PowerPC chips.
 .
 CODE ORGANIZATION
 .
 mpn/powerpc64          mode-neutral code
 mpn/powerpc64/mode32   code for mode32
 mpn/powerpc64/mode64   code for mode64
 .
 The mode32 and mode64 sub-directories contain code which is for use in the
 respective chip mode, 32 or 64.  The top-level directory is code that's
 unaffected by the mode.
 .
 The "adde" instruction is the main difference between mode32 and mode64.  It
 operates on either on a 32-bit or 64-bit quantity according to the chip mode.
 Other instructions have an operand size in their opcode and hence don't vary.
 .
 POWER3/PPC630 pipeline information:
 .
 Decoding is 4-way + branch and issue is 8-way with some out-of-order
 capability.
 .
 Functional units:
 LS1  - ld/st unit 1
 LS2  - ld/st unit 2
 FXU1 - integer unit 1, handles any simple integer instruction
 FXU2 - integer unit 2, handles any simple integer instruction
 FXU3 - integer unit 3, handles integer multiply and divide
 FPU1 - floating-point unit 1
 FPU2 - floating-point unit 2
 .
 Memory:		  Any two memory operations can issue, but memory subsystem
 can sustain just one store per cycle.  No need for data
 prefetch; the hardware has very sophisticated prefetch logic.
 Simple integer:	  2 operations (such as add, rl*)
 Integer multiply: 1 operation every 9th cycle worst case; exact timing depends
 on 2nd operand's most significant bit position (10 bits per
 cycle).  Multiply unit is not pipelined, only one multiply
 operation in progress is allowed.

 should be possible to reach the cache bandwith 1.5 cycles/limb at least
 with PA8500.  The problem now is stalling of the first SUB,DB after LDO,
 where the processor gets confused about where carry comes from.

 RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES
 .
 Load and Store timing
 .
 On the PA7000 no memory instructions can issue the two cycles after a store.
 For the PA7100, this is reduced to one cycle.
 .
 The PA7100 has a lookup-free cache, so it helps to schedule loads and the
 dependent instruction really far from each other.

 The PA8x00 processors have an orthogonal 4-way out-of-order pipeline.  Each
 cycle two ALU operations and two MEM operations can issue, but just one of the
 MEM operations may be a store.  The two ALU operations can be almost any
 combination of non-memory operations.  Unlike every other processor, integer
 and fp operations are completely equal here; they both count as just ALU
 operations.
 .
 Unfortunately, some operations cause hickups in the pipeline.  Combining
 carry-consuming operations like ADD,DC with operations that does not set carry
 like ADD,L cause long delays.  Skip operations also seem to cause hickups.  If
 several ADD,DC are issued consecutively, or if plain carry-generating ADD feed
 ADD,DC, stalling does not occur.  We can effectively issue two ADD,DC
 operations/cycle.
 .
 Latency scheduling is not as important as making sure to have a mix of ALU and
 MEM operations, but for full pipeline utilization, it is still a good idea to
 do some amount of latency scheduling.
 .
 Like for all other processors, RAW memory scheduling is critically important.
 Since integer multiplication takes place in the floating-point unit, the GMP
 code needs to handle this problem frequently.

 This directory contains mpn functions for various SPARC chips.  Code that
 runs only on version 8 SPARC implementations, is in the v8 subdirectory.
 .
 RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES
 .
 Load and Store timing
 .
 On most early SPARC implementations, the ST instructions takes multiple
 cycles, while a STD takes just a single cycle more than an ST.  For the CPUs
 in SPARCstation I and II, the times are 3 and 4 cycles, respectively.
 Therefore, combining two ST instructions into a STD when possible is a
 significant optimization.
 .
 Later SPARC implementations have single cycle ST.
 .
 For SuperSPARC, we can perform just one memory instruction per cycle, even
 if up to two integer instructions can be executed in its pipeline.  For
 programs that perform so many memory operations that there are not enough
 non-memory operations to issue in parallel with all memory operations, using
 LDD and STD when possible helps.
 .
 UltraSPARC-1/2 has very slow integer multiplication.  In the v9 subdirectory,
 we therefore use floating-point multiplication.
 .

 Runs at 3.0 cycles/limb.  With unrolling, the ulimb load and the 3
 bookkeeping increments and the `bis' that copies from r22 to r6 could be
 removed and the instruction count reduced from 26 to to 21.  We could
 thereby probably reach 2 cycles/limb, the IMUL bandwidth.

 This runs at 2 cycles/limb on PA8000 and 1.6875 cycles/limb on PA8500.  It
 should be possible to reach the cache bandwith 1.5 cycles/limb at least
 with PA8500.  The problem now is stalling of the first ADD,DC after LDO,
 where the processor gets confused about where carry comes from.

Copyright: 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
 the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
 modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
 this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
 credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
 under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
 such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
 addressed as "you".
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
 (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
 within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
 textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
 mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
 as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the
 general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
 for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
 to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
 format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
 subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
 not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
 PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
 by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
 purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
 formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
 the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
 conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
 you may publicly display copies.
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
 and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
 the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
 the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
 Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
 general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
 charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
 option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
 distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
 until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
 copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
 the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
 them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
 the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
 of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
 from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
 (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
 of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
 if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
 responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
 Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
 Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
 Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
 adjacent to the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
 giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
 terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
 and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
 it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
 publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
 there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
 stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
 given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
 Version as stated in the previous sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
 public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
 the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
 it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
 least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
 publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
 K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
 preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
 substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
 and/or dedications given therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
 unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
 or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
 may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
 or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
 passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
 of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
 by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
 you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
 give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
 imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
 License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
 Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
 in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
 "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
 and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
 entitled "Endorsements."
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
 other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
 of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
 compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
 License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
 with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
 are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
 of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
 Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
 translation of this License provided that you also include the
 original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
 between the translation and the original English version of this
 License, the original English version will prevail.
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
 copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
 of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
 License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
 of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 .
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 .
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 .
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 .
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)
 .
 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.
 .
 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 .
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.
 .
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 .
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 Lesser General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

 ansi2knr is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
 WARRANTY.  No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for the
 consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or
 works at all, unless he says so in writing.  Refer to the GNU General Public

 .
 Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute ansi2knr,
 but only under the conditions described in the GPL.  A copy of this license
 is supposed to have been given to you along with ansi2knr so you can know
 your rights and responsibilities.  It should be in a file named COPYLEFT,

 things, the copyright notice and this notice must be preserved on all
 copies.

 We explicitly state here what we believe is already implied by the GPL: if
 the ansi2knr program is distributed as a separate set of sources and a
 separate executable file which are aggregated on a storage medium together
 with another program, this in itself does not bring the other program under
 the GPL, nor does the mere fact that such a program or the procedures for
 constructing it invoke the ansi2knr executable bring any other part of the
 program under the GPL.

 Notes:
 .
 m4 isn't perfect for processing BSD style x86 assembler code, the main
 problems are,
 .
 1. Doing define(foo,123) and then using foo in an addressing mode like
 foo(%ebx) expands as a macro rather than a constant.  This is worked
 around by using deflit() from asm-defs.m4, instead of define().
 .
 2. Immediates in macro definitions need a space or `' to stop the $
 looking like a macro parameter.  For example,
 .
 define(foo, `mov $ 123, %eax')
 .
 This is only a problem in macro definitions, not in ordinary text,
 and not in macro parameters like text passed to forloop() or ifdef().

 The code here implements a subset (a very limited subset) of the main GMP
 functions.  It's designed for use in a few build-time calculations and
 will be slow, but highly portable.

 None of the normal GMP configure things are used, nor any of the normal
 gmp.h or gmp-impl.h.  To use this file in a program just #include
 "dumbmp.c".

 ANSI function definitions can be used here, since ansi2knr is run if
 necessary.  But other ANSI-isms like "const" should be avoided.

Files:     src/libffi/LICENSE-BUILDTOOLS
Copyright: 1989-1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 received the program in object code or executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 .
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 .
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 .
 <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
 Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.

 A really simple-minded text editor based on cords.
 Things it does right:
 No size bounds.
 Inbounded undo.
 Shouldn't crash no matter what file you invoke it on (e.g. /vmunix)
 (Make sure /vmunix is not writable before you try this.)
 Scrolls horizontally.
 Things it does wrong:
 It doesn't handle tabs reasonably (use "expand" first).
 The command set is MUCH too small.
 The redisplay algorithm doesn't let curses do the scrolling.
 The rule for moving the window over the file is suboptimal.

 Larry Masinter's simple code walker
 .
 .
 boy, thats fair (I hope).
 .
 For now at least, this code walker really only does what PCL needs it to
 do.  Maybe it will grow up someday.
 .
 This code walker used to be completely portable.  Now it is just "Real
 easy to port".  This change had to happen because the hack that made it
 completely portable kept breaking in different releases of different
 Common Lisps, and in addition it never worked entirely anyways.  So,
 its now easy to port.  To port this walker, all you have to write is one
 simple macro and two simple functions.  These macros and functions are
 used by the walker to manipluate the macroexpansion environments of
 the Common Lisp it is running in.
 .
 The code which implements the macroexpansion environment manipulation
 mechanisms is in the first part of the file, the real walker follows it.
 .
 The user entry points are walk-form and nested-walked-form.  In addition,
 it is legal for user code to call the variable information functions:
 variable-lexical-p, variable-special-p and variable-class.  Some users
 will need to call define-walker-template, they will have to figure that
 out for themselves.

 .
 The function proclamations are created with PROCLAIM-FUNCTION, as in
 .
 (PROCLAMATION function-name ([arg-type]*) return-type
 &rest {:no-sp-change|:pure|:reader|:no-side-effects})
 .
 with the following interpretation: ARG-TYPE and RETURN-TYPE denote the most
 general types for the input and output values of this function. If the
 compiler detects that some of the values passed to this function does not
 match these types, it will generate an error. In addition to this, ECL
 contemplates different function properties:
 .
 :NO-SP-CHANGE indicates that the function does not change the value of any
 special variable, and it is used to perform code transformations.
 .
 :NO-SIDE-EFFECTS is slightly stronger, as it indicates that the function
 does not change variables or the content of objects in the
 thread environment. Note the following:
 .
 - Allocating memory, creating objects, etc is not considered a side
 effect, as it does not affect the code flow.
 - Similarly, signalling errors is not considered a side effect.
 - The environment may be changed by other threads. This is taken
 into account (see below).
 .
 :READER indicates that the function not only has no side effects, but its
 value depends only on its arguments. However, :READER specifies that
 the arguments are mutable.
 .
 :PURE is the strictest class of functions. They have no side effects, the
 output only depends on the arguments, the arguments are immutable
 objects and the function call can be optimized away when the
 arguments are constant.

 This is a simple API to implement pointer back tracing, i.e.
 to answer questions such as "who is pointing to this" or
 "why is this object being retained by the collector"
 .
 This API assumes that we have an ANSI C compiler.
 .
 Most of these calls yield useful information on only after
 a garbage collection.  Usually the client will first force
 a full collection and then gather information, preferably
 before much intervening allocation.
 .
 The implementation of the interface is only about 99.9999%
 correct.  It is intended to be good enough for profiling,
 but is not intended to be used with production code.
 .
 Results are likely to be much more useful if all allocation is
 accomplished through the debugging allocators.
 .
 The implementation idea is due to A. Demers.

 This is a string packages that uses a tree-based representation.
 See cord.h for a description of the functions provided.  Ec.h describes
 "extensible cords", which are essentially output streams that write
 to a cord.  These allow for efficient construction of cords without
 requiring a bound on the size of a cord.
 .
 More details on the data structure can be found in
 .
 Boehm, Atkinson, and Plass, "Ropes: An Alternative to Strings",
 Software Practice and Experience 25, 12, December 1995, pp. 1315-1330.
 .
 A fundamentally similar "rope" data structure is also part of SGI's standard
 template library implementation, and its descendants, which include the
 GNU C++ library.  That uses reference counting by default.
 There is a short description of that data structure at
 http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/ropeimpl.html .
 .
 All of these are descendants of the "ropes" in Xerox Cedar.
 .
 cord/tests/de.c is a very dumb text editor that illustrates the use of cords.
 It maintains a list of file versions.  Each version is simply a
 cord representing the file contents.  Nonetheless, standard
 editing operations are efficient, even on very large files.
 (Its 3 line "user manual" can be obtained by invoking it without
 arguments.  Note that ^R^N and ^R^P move the cursor by
 almost a screen.  It does not understand tabs, which will show
 up as highlighted "I"s.  Use the UNIX "expand" program first.)
 To build the editor, type "make cord/de" in the gc directory.
 .
 This package assumes an ANSI C compiler such as gcc.  It will
 not compile with an old-style K&R compiler.

 This is mostly an internal header file.  Typical clients should
 not use it.  Clients that define their own object kinds with
 debugging allocators will probably want to include this, however.
 No attempt is made to keep the namespace clean.  This should not be
 included from header files that are frequently included by clients.

 - Memory references in general are atomic only for a single

 operands of standard types.  WE FOOLISHLY ASSUME that
 compilers only generate those.  If that turns out to be

 use of those files for a purpose other than building the collector may

 This contains interfaces to the GC marker that are likely to be useful to
 clients that provide detailed heap layout information to the collector.
 This interface should not be used by normal C or C++ clients.
 It will be useful to runtimes for other languages.

 This is an experts-only interface!  There are many ways to break the
 collector in subtle ways by using this functionality.

 WeakPointer
 .
 A weak pointer is a pointer to a heap-allocated object that doesn't
 prevent the object from being garbage collected. Weak pointers can be
 used to track which objects haven't yet been reclaimed by the
 collector. A weak pointer is deactivated when the collector discovers
 its referent object is unreachable by normal pointers (reachability
 and deactivation are defined more precisely below). A deactivated weak
 pointer remains deactivated forever.

 Cords are immutable character strings.  A number of operations
 on long cords are much more efficient than their strings.h counterpart.
 In particular, concatenation takes constant time independent of the length
 of the arguments.  (Cords are represented as trees, with internal
 nodes representing concatenation and leaves consisting of either C
 strings or a functional description of the string.)
 .
 The following are reasonable applications of cords.  They would perform
 unacceptably if C strings were used:
 - A compiler that produces assembly language output by repeatedly
 concatenating instructions onto a cord representing the output file.
 - A text editor that converts the input file to a cord, and then
 performs editing operations by producing a new cord representing
 the file after each character change (and keeping the old ones in an
 edit history)
 .
 For optimal performance, cords should be built by
 concatenating short sections.
 This interface is designed for maximum compatibility with C strings.

 In Common Lisp, comparisons between floats and integers are performed
 via an intermediate rationalization of the floating point number. In C,
 on the other hand, the comparison is performed by converting the integer
 into a floating point number. However, if the double type is too small
 this may lead to a loss of precision and two numbers being told equal
 when, by Common Lisp standards, would not.

 .
 The original ASDF-INSTALL code (the files Makefile, README,
 asdf-install.asd, defpackage.lisp, and installer.lisp) was written by
 Daniel Barlow <dan@telent.net> and is distributed with SBCL and
 therefore in the public domain.  The SBCL Common Lisp implementation
 can be obtained from Sourceforge: <http://sbcl.sf.net/>.
 .
 The initial port of ASDF-INSTALL to other Lisps was done by Dr. Edmund
 Weitz <edi@agharta.de> and included the file port.lisp and some
 changes to the files mentioned above.  More code was provided by Marco
 Baringer <mb@bese.it> (OpenMCL port), James Anderson
 <james.anderson@setf.de> (MCL port, including the file digitool.lisp),
 Kiyoshi Mizumaru <maru@krc.sony.co.jp>, Robert P. Goldman
 <rpgoldman@sift.info>, and Raymond Toy <toy@rtp.ericsson.se>
 (bugfixes).  Marco Antoniotti <marcoxa@cs.nyu.edu> added support for
 MK:DEFSYSTEM which includes the files load-asdf-install.lisp,
 loader.lisp, and finally split-sequence.lisp which has its own
 copyright notice. ASDF-Install is currently maintained by Gary King

 IA-64 MPN SUBROUTINES
 .
 This directory contains mpn functions for the IA-64 architecture.
 .
 CODE ORGANIZATION
 .
 mpn/ia64          itanium-2, and generic ia64
 .
 The code here has been optimized primarily for Itanium 2.  Very few Itanium 1
 chips were ever sold, and Itanium 2 is more powerful, so the latter is what
 we concentrate on.
 .
 CHIP NOTES
 .
 The IA-64 ISA keeps instructions three and three in 128 bit bundles.
 Programmers/compilers need to put explicit breaks `;;' when there are WAW or
 RAW dependencies, with some notable exceptions.  Such "breaks" are typically
 at the end of a bundle, but can be put between operations within some bundle
 types too.
 .
 The Itanium 1 and Itanium 2 implementations can under ideal conditions
 execute two bundles per cycle.  The Itanium 2 allows 4 of these instructions
 to do integer operations, while the Itanium 2 allows all 6 to be integer
 operations.
 .
 Taken cloop branches seem to insert a bubble into the pipeline most of the
 time on Itanium 1.
 .
 Loads to the fp registers bypass the L1 cache and thus get extremely long
 latencies, 9 cycles on the Itanium 1 and 6 cycles on the Itanium 2.
 .
 The software pipeline stuff using br.ctop instruction causes delays, since
 many issue slots are taken up by instructions with zero predicates, and
 since many extra instructions are needed to set things up.  These features
 are clearly designed for code density, not speed.
 .
 Misc pipeline limitations (Itanium 1):
 * The getf.sig instruction can only execute in M0.
 * At most four integer instructions/cycle.
 * Nops take up resources like any plain instructions.
 .
 Misc pipeline limitations (Itanium 2):
 * The getf.sig instruction can only execute in M0.
 * Nops take up resources like any plain instructions.
 .
 ASSEMBLY SYNTAX
 .
 .align pads with nops in a text segment, but gas 2.14 and earlier
 incorrectly byte-swaps its nop bundle in big endian mode (eg. hpux), making
 it come out as break instructions.  We use the ALIGN() macro in
 mpn/ia64/ia64-defs.m4 when it might be executed across.  That macro
 suppresses any .align if the problem is detected by configure.  Lack of
 alignment might hurt performance but will at least be correct.
 .
 foo:: to create a global symbol is not accepted by gas.  Use separate
 ".global foo" and "foo:" instead.
 .
 .global is the standard global directive.  gas accepts .globl, but hpux "as"
 doesn't.
 .
 .proc / .endp generates the appropriate .type and .size information for ELF,
 so the latter directives don't need to be given explicitly.
 .
 .pred.rel "mutex"... is standard for annotating predicate register
 relationships.  gas also accepts .pred.rel.mutex, but hpux "as" doesn't.
 .
 .pred directives can't be put on a line with a label, like
 ".Lfoo: .pred ...", the HP assembler on HP-UX 11.23 rejects that.
 gas is happy with it, and past versions of HP had seemed ok.
 .
 // is the standard comment sequence, but we prefer "C" since it inhibits m4
 macro expansion.  See comments in ia64-defs.m4.
 .
 REGISTER USAGE

 r0: constant 0
 r1: global pointer (gp)

 HOW WE HANDLE SIGNALS AND EXCEPTIONS
 .
 (the following should be correlated with the manual)
 .
 POSIX contemplates the notion of "signals", which are events that
 cause a process or a thread to be interrupted. Windows uses the
 term "exception", which includes also a more general kind of
 errors.
 .
 In both cases the consequence is that a thread or process may be
 interrupted at any time, either by causes which are intrinsic to
 them (synchronous signals), such as floating point exceptions, or
 extrinsic (asynchronous signals), such as the process being aborted
 by the user.
 .
 Of course, those interruptions are not always welcome. When the
 interrupt is delivered and a handler is invoked, the thread or even
 the whole program may be in an inconsistent state. For instance the
 thread may have acquired a lock, or it may be in the process of
 filling the fields of a structure. Understanding this POSIX
 restricts severely what functions can be called from a signal
 handler, thereby limiting its usefulness.
 .
 There is a simple solution, which ECL uses, and which is to mark
 sections of code which are interruptible, and in which it is safe
 for the handler to run arbitrary code, protect anything else. In
 principle this "marking" can be done using POSIX functions such as
 .

 		       Version 2, June 1991
 .
  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
 .
 			    Preamble
 .
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
 other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
 your libraries, too.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
 with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
 the original authors' reputations.
 .
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
 transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
 free use or not licensed at all.
 .
   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
 designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
 one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
 the same as in the ordinary license.
 .
   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
 program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
 analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
 treats it as such.
 .
   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
 .
   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
 libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
 permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
 libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
 changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
 will lead to faster development of free libraries.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
 works together with the library.
 .
   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
 General Public License rather than by this special one.
 .
 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
 General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
 addressed as "you".
 .
   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 .
   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 .
   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)
 .
     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.
 .
     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 .
   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.
 .
     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 .
   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 .
   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
 			    NO WARRANTY
 .
   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 .
   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Library General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
     Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
 .
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 That's all there is to it!
